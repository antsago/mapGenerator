        <h3>Erosion</h3>
        <p>The results of this process can be a little bit on the blobby side, which means they rarely look good on their
            own. We want to scuff them up a bit, so they look more like real landscapes. We do this by applying an erosion
            operation.</p>
        <p>In most of the world, by far the largest influence on the shape of landforms is fluvial (water-based) erosion.
            Water flows downhill, carrying sediment along with it, carving out valleys and river basins. This is a massively
            complex phenomenon, and modelling it correctly is a very active research area, but we can get a long way
            by sketching a simple version of the process.</p>
        <p>We need to start by tracing the routes that water would take over the grid. For each grid point, we say that
            water flows to its lowest neighbour, and so on down until we reach the edge of the map. This gives a map
            of water flow.</p>
        <p>There's an obvious problem when we reach gridpoints which are lower than all of their neighbours. Do we route
            the water back uphill? This will probably lead to cycles in the water system, which are trouble. Instead,
            we want to fill in these gaps (often called sinks or depressions), so that the water always runs downhill
            all the way to the edge.</p>
        <p>It's easy to see how to fill in a single gridpoint, but as the depression gets bigger, and possibly links up
            with other depressions, the number of possible cases multiplies enormously. Luckily, there's an algorithm
            for filling depressions, called the Planchon-Darboux algorithm.</p>
        <div class="example">

            <h4>Aside: the Planchon-Darboux algorithm</h4>

            <p>The algorithm works by finding the lowest surface with the following two properties:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The surface is everywhere at least as high as the input surface</li>
                <li>Every non-edge point has a neighbour which is lower than it</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To calculate this, we start with an infinitely high surface everywhere except on the edge, where we use the
                original heights. Then, on each iteration, we find points which have a neighbour which is lower than
                them, and set their height to their original height, or the height of their lowest neighbour (plus a
                small amount), whichever is higher. We halt when we can go a full iteration without changing any point.</p>

            <p>There are various ways of speeding up this algorithm, mostly by tweaking the order in which points are visited.
                For more details, and a proof of correctness, you can read
                <a href="http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/sous_copyright/010031925.pdf">the original paper</a>.</p>

        </div>

        <p>With the water routing calculated, we can work out how much water is flowing through each point. I assume that
            rainfall is constant across the whole map, and iterate through the points in descending order, passing the
            rainfall, plus the accumulated water flux, from each point to its 'downhill point'. This gives a map of water
            flux, which usually converges into a nice branching river structure, with lots of small streams feeding a
            larger central channel.</p>
        <p>To calculate erosion, I combine the water flux with the slope at each point, as calculated based on the triangle
            of its neighbours. The exact formula I use is the product of the slope with the square root of the water
            flux. This isn't necessarily very physical, but it does give nice-looking results. I also add a small term
            which is proportional to the slope squared. This prevents deep gorges from forming, which might be physically
            realistic, but don't look good in the graphical style I've chosen.</p>
        <p>I find it's very important to cap the erosion rate, otherwise strange things can happen. A little goes a very
            long way with this. Also, erosion always lowers the surface, so it usually helps to drop the sea level afterwards
            to match.</p>
        <p>A final tweak to the heightmap is to smooth out the coastlines slightly. The erosion tends to produce quite rough
            terrain, which becomes tiny islands when cut off by sea level. A few of these can look good, but too many
            just looks messy. I repeatedly apply a filter where points which are below sea level, but a majority of whose
            neighbours are above sea level, get pulled up, and vice versa for points which are above sea level and have
            undersea neighbours. A couple of repeats of this produces a much cleaner coastline.</p>
        <div class="example" id="erode">

        </div>

        <h3>Rendering terrain</h3>
        <p>Now comes the question of drawing the map (at least the physical portion). The easy part is the coastline - we've
            been doing this already. It's just a matter of drawing line segments where the heightmap crosses zero. There's
            not a lot extra to do about this.</p>
        <p>The next component is the rivers. We don't want to display the entire drainage network, because that would cover
            the whole map. Instead, we only show the drainage from points with above a certain threshold of water flux.
            By connecting these points to their downstream neighbours, we can trace out the river paths.</p>
        <p>One problem with this approach is that the rivers tend to zigzag from grid point to grid point, rather than following
            a smooth path. To solve this, I relax the points in the middle of the path towards their upstream and downstream
            neighbours (keeping the top and bottom fixed, so that intersections work properly). This smooths things out
            beautifully.</p>
        <p>The final part of this is the shading on the sides of hills, which helps indicate the topography. It is a central
            principle of cartography that we tend to interpret maps as though viewing the terrain from the bottom of
            the map, looking towards the top. So we want to draw strokes which go up and right if the terrain slopes
            upwards from left to right, and down and right if the terrain slopes downwards. Similarly, the strokes on
            the 'near' side of hills should be longer than those on the 'far' side.</p>
        <p>For each grid point, I calculate the slope, and ignore the point if it is less than a random threshold. For points
            which pass this test, I draw a short stroke with slope proportional to the horizontal component of the heightmap
            slope, with a small modifier for the vertical component. If the stroke would be too steep, I split it into
            several shorter strokes, at the maximum slope, drawn at random around the point.</p>
        <div class="example" id="phys">

        </div>

        <h3>Cities, borders</h3>
        <p>Now that we have the 'physical' portion of the map sorted, we can move to looking at the 'political'. We want
            to place cities and towns on the map in feasible-looking locations. At the same time, we want the cities
            to be spread out enough that we can put labels on them without worrying too much about overlap.
        </p>
        <p>To place a city, I generate a score for each point, which is a combination of three things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Water flux - we want cities to be preferentially located on rivers, so high water flux gets a bonus</li>
            <li>Distance from other cities - we want cities to be spread out, so penalize locations which are too close to
                an existing city</li>
            <li>Distance from the edge of the map - the other two criteria alone tend to push cities to the map edge, which
                isn't ideal, so penalize locations too close to the edge</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every time I add a city, I choose the point with the highest score, then recalculate the scores for all points.
            I make a distinction between cities, which have a 'region' associated with them, and towns, which don't.
            The cities are placed first, but otherwise there's no distinction in the code.</p>
        <p>The next step is to mark out the regions. We want the borders between regions to seem fairly reasonable, following
            natural borders like rivers and mountain ranges. The way I approach this is to expand regions outwards from
            each city, so that each region consists of the points which are 'closest' to its city, according to a particular
            distance measure. This distance measure is calculated by adding up the cost of the route, based on these
            criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Horizontal distance</li>
            <li>Slope - uphill is much cheaper than downhill, so regions expand until they hit the top of ridges, then stop</li>
            <li>Water flux - crossing a river is expensive</li>
            <li>Shorelines - there is a large penalty for going from land to water (or vice versa), and a smaller penalty
                for travelling by water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally, the borders are drawn, using the same smoothing technique as the rivers.</p>
        <div class="example" id="city">

        </div>

        <h3>Placing labels</h3>
        <p>At this point we can start naming things, using the process described in
            <a href="/notes/naming-language/">these notes
            </a>. I generate names for cities, towns and regions, using a consistent language for the whole map.</p>
        <p>The very last part of the process is to place the labels, avoiding overlaps, obscured cities, labels going off
            the edge of the map, etc. This sounds easy, but it really really isn't. Ideally, some sort of intelligent
            layout algorithm would place all the labels, rearranging as necessary. Instead, I have a few hundred lines
            of spaghetti code which seems to get the right answer most of the time, but which is packed full of magic
            numbers.</p>
        <p>In rough outline, what happens is this: the labels are placed in the order 1. cities, 2. towns, 3. regions. For
            cities and towns, there are four possible slots for the label, above, below, and to each side of the marker.
            Each label is placed, attempting to avoid the following overlaps (in rough order of importance):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>City markers</li>
            <li>Other city labels</li>
            <li>The map edge</li>
            <li>Borders</li>
            <li>Coastlines</li>
            <li>Rivers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Obviously it's not usually possible to avoid all of these, so the least bad solution is chosen.</p>
        <p>For regions, there's a bit more freedom in where to place the label, but the labels are also bigger, and the
            map is more cluttered at this point. The scoring system rates positions based on proximity to the center
            of the region, as well as being over land, and penalties for all the overlaps mentioned before.
        </p>
        <div class="example" id="final">
            <p>I wanted to make a nice interactive example for this, but trying to separate out the label placement code
                made me feel physically unwell. Sorry about that.</p>
        </div>

        <p>So that's the algorithm, at least in rough outline. The actual code running on the bot has a few other little
            bits and pieces, which honestly don't do much, but removing them is more trouble than it's worth when the
            code is working as it stands. The JavaScript code behind this page is available
            <a href="https://github.com/mewo2/terrain">on GitHub
            </a>, and if you're really really brave you can look at the original
            <a href="https://github.com/mewo2/deserts">Python code</a> which was written while I was figuring all this out.</p>
        <p>There's obviously lots that could be done to improve this. Erosion is just one process, and the next obvious
            thing to add would be fluvial deposition, which would allow for flood plains, river deltas, etc to form.
            If you wanted more realistic mountains, then glacial processes would be worth looking at. Volcanic stuff
            could also be fun.</p>
        <p>On the graphical side, it could be fun to try to sketch more interesting textures on the map, such as forests
            or fields. Or you could fill the oceans with sea monsters and lost ships. If you're really brave, you could
            even look at labelling more features, like mountain ranges and rivers.</p>
        <p>As always, if you do any of these things, or make anything else interesting with this code or these ideas, please
            get in touch and let me know.</p>
